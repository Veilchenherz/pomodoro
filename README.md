# Pomodoro Timer Desktop App
This is a simple Desktop App containing a pomodoro timer. If the timer is started, it automatically progresses through the different phases of the pomodoro technique:
1. After every work unit, a short break is started
2. After every fourth work unit, a long break is started

You can set the durations of the working, short and long break units.
